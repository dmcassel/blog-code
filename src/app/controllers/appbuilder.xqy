xquery version "1.0-ml";

module namespace c = "http://marklogic.com/roxy/controller/appbuilder";

(: the controller helper library provides methods to control which view and template get rendered :)
import module namespace ch = "http://marklogic.com/roxy/controller-helper" at "/roxy/lib/controller-helper.xqy";

(: The request library provides awesome helper methods to abstract get-request-field :)
import module namespace req = "http://marklogic.com/roxy/request" at "/roxy/lib/request.xqy";

import module namespace s = "http://marklogic.com/roxy/models/search" at "/app/models/search-lib.xqy";

declare option xdmp:mapping "false";

(:
 : Usage Notes:
 :
 : use the ch library to pass variables to the view
 :
 : use the request (req) library to get access to request parameters easily

declare function c:main() as item()*
{
  let $q as xs:string := req:get("q", "", "type=xs:string")
  let $page := req:get("page", 1, "type=xs:int")
  return
  (
    ch:add-value("response", s:search($q, $page)),
    ch:add-value("q", $q),
    ch:add-value("page", $page)
  ),
  ch:use-view((), "xml"),
  ch:use-layout((), "xml")
